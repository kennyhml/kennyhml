**`Passionate Software Developer | Automating Repetitive Tasks for Enhanced Experiences`**

I'm Kenny, an aspiring software developer with fondness for Python and a passion for creating automation solutions that tackle repetitive tasks.

Throughout my journey, I have honed my skills in Python and gained a deep understanding of its capabilities. I have leveraged this knowledge to develop projects from the ground up, crafting custom solutions that streamline and optimize repetitive processes.

My work revolves around developing bots that handle repetitive actions, freeing up precious time and energy for gamers to focus on the aspects of the game they enjoy the most. Please note that I prioritize the experience and fairness of other players, ensuring that my solutions have a positive impact on the gaming community without causing disruption.

Creating video game bots was the perfect gateway into programming for me. It combined my pre-existing interest with my ideas for the future, providing a solid motivation for my continued growth as a software developer.

With this foundation, I have expanded my skill set in areas such as computer vision, graphical user interfaces, web development, and database management. Through practical experience, I have gained applied knowledge in computer vision using cv2 and numpy, designed graphical user interfaces with PyQt and matplotlib, and effectively managed user data and API endpoints using Flask, Django, SQL, MongoDB, and requests.
